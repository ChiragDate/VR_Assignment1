## Overview

This repository contains implementations for two computer vision tasks:

1. **Coin Detection & Segmentation:**  
   Detect and segment coins from an input image, then count the total number of coins.

2. **Panorama Creation:**  
   Stitch multiple overlapping images to create a seamless panoramic image using feature extraction, matching, homography estimation, and image warping.

> **Note:** The code is self-contained and will run without any additional intervention once the dependencies are installed.
